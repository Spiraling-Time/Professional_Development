Professional Development

You are Kyle, the famous game developer of instant hits like Chicken the Man, test_project_03, and Siksolng. You are attending a game jam held in an abandoned wing of a library. You will need to assemble the perfect team for this game, and you only have 100 seconds to do it! Be careful though, space is limited. You will need to pick the best of the best if you hope to win. Unfortunately, that means you will have to keep away the fans and knife wielding maniacs. Perhaps you can do something with them another day. Stay professional!

You can play the game on itch.io in browser here https://spiraling-time.itch.io/professional-development

Made for Hack Club's Summer of Making Game Jam
